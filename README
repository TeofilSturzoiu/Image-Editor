This homework was based on a "Console image editor", coded in C:

The program can modify images: crop, rotate, save, load and apply certain
filters (blur, sharpen, gaussian blur, edge detection).

I use dynamic allocation and it works on both ppm and pgm formats.
The commands are stated in the homework (LOAD, SELECT, and so on...)

Explaination of the code
========================
I splitted the code among multiple files which work together to apply all
commands. The files have suggestive names, so no further explaination is
needed.

The only function I feel like diving into is apply_photo. I check if the
coordinates are OK and then use the algorithm detailed in the statement
of our homework:

-> parse through the matrix and for each pixel, I select its neighbours and
multiply them by the value stored in each kernel_matrix.
-> I store the results in a new matrix and then copy them in the old matrix.

All photos are stored using double type for the precision, and I print all
values as unsigned chars.

I feel like comments are good enough for a complete understanding.


Have a good day!
